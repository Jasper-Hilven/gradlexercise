# Gradle exercise

In this exercise, we will work on the three build phases: Initialization, configuration and execution. 
You can find more info on build phases here: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#sec:build_phases

Try to replace all the "When is this executed?" strings with one of the following:
* "This is executed during the Initialization phase."
* "This is executed during the Configuration phase."
* "This is executed during the Execution phase."

You can see if your build file correct by running the tasks "./gradlew secondTask" or "./gradlew firstTask".
